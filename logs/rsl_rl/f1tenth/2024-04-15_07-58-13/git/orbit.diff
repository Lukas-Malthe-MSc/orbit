On branch attention
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	logs/rsl_rl/f1tenth/2024-04-15_07-58-13/


It took 2.83 seconds to enumerate untracked files. 'status -uno'
may speed it up, but you have to be careful not to forget to add
new files yourself (see 'git help status').
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
